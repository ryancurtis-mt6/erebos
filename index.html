Erebos capitalizes on storytelling and gameplay techniques developed in the genre for over a decade. By doing so, Erebos ensures a committed, semi-serious roleplay experience, free from common hindrances, such as roleplay authority and bureaucracy.<br/><br/>Erebos brings together a diverse community by combining a flurry of interests, ensuring there is a taste for everyone. If you are intrigued by the SCP Universe's research, combat, politics, maintenance, or development: <b>Erebos has it.</b></div></div><div id="isntw-3"><div id="it6lm-3">What is Erebos?<br/></div><div id="iebuk-3">Named after Erebus, the Greek personification of darkness, Erebos is a custom canon that allows our roleplay experience—explored through Roblox experiences—to be developed with significant creative liberties. A story and canon unique to our community inspires creative freedom and unbinds us from the most restrictive traits commonly associated with similar communities on that platform.<br/><br/>Erebos intends to explore the dark, twisted, and scary elements of the SCP Universe, exploring its roots: the unknown. Erebos aims to unlock the full potential of SCP by capitalizing on the fear of the unknown, the fear of the inhuman, and the fear of things out of our control.</div></div><div id="isntw-2"><div id="it6lm-2">How Does Erebos Work?<br/></div><div id="iebuk-2">Erebos recognizes the need to have decisions made outside the roleplay apparatus and its membership. As such, Erebos is governed by a simple conduct code that ensures a safe community and a semi-serious roleplay environment. The Erebos Canon Commission manages this conduct code and the Erebos community. The Commission handles community safety, development, and moderation matters, with those on the Commission not being promoted through professional experience, not roleplay experience.<br/><br/>This structure enables the community membership to regulate their roleplay rules, with more serious parts of management being delegated to the Commission.</div></div><div id="ix049"><div id="ivg79">JOINING EREBOS<br/></div><div id="i6r93">Joining the Erebos community is easy!
